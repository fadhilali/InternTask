# InternTask
This is a very simple portal API connected to the database. use the compressed file (fadhilsample.zip) 
The used MySQL database called "register2" (register2.sql) which has two tables (users and new_record)
The language used here is php and make a folder called css and put the style.css in that folder.
However, after the all files download, try to import the database by using XAMPP server phpmyadmin.
Use any browser to login that portal easily by using: localhost/htdocs/fadhilsample
where the (fadhilsample) is the used directory or make your own directory to see the portal (try to use the fadhilsample.zip file)
You have to register first to login and make your records accordingly by using the (Insert new record)
You can Edit or Delete any record.
Due to this task is a very simple one, the table will show the ID number, the person's name, and the age.
the editing for the two fields (name and/or age) 
You can easily view the record at any time.
So, this portal has designed as simple as possible to show the connection between the databse "register2" and the web pages (php) 

For any future work, this work can be improved to designed immutable,colored,bootstraped, and filtered tables and connect them to a database.

Please, feel free to contact me if you have any questions

Thanks!
